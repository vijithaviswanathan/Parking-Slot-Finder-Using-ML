This project is to develop a system that can automatically detect and classify available parking spots in a parking lot using machine learning techniques. This involves using computer vision to analyze images or video streams from cameras placed in the parking lot.

## Steps Involved

1.Data Collection:

Gathered a large dataset of images or videos of parking lots with labeled annotations indicating whether each parking spot is occupied or vacant. This dataset is crucial for training the machine learning model.

2.Preprocessing:

Prepared the dataset by cleaning the data, resizing images if necessary, and ensuring consistent labeling of occupied and vacant parking spots.

3.Model Training:

Trained the  model using the prepared dataset. This involves feeding the images into the model and adjusting its parameters iteratively to improve accuracy in detecting occupied and vacant parking spots.

4.Integration with Cameras:

Implemented the trained model to process live video feeds from cameras installed in the parking lot. This involves setting up a pipeline where frames from the camera feed are passed through the model for real-time analysis.

5.Occupancy Detection:

Implemented logic to interpret the output of the model to determine the occupancy status of each parking spot. This could involve setting a threshold confidence level above which a spot is classified as occupied.

6.User Interface:

Developed a user interface that displays the parking lot layout with real-time updates on the status of each parking spot. This can be a web-based dashboard or a mobile application where users can see which spots are available.

7.Alerts and Notifications:

Optionally, integrated features to send alerts or notifications to users when a parking spot becomes available, helping them quickly find and navigate to an open spot.
